            <h1>Boiled Eggs and Nostalgia</h1>

  <p>Boiled eggs are a fond memory of mine. They always brought about a sense of nostalgia, filling my mind with memories of simplicity before I needed to consider being approved or accountable. To everyone else, they were merely a small side dish for breakfast, but to me they meant more. My family depended on them every day when I was young, maybe too much in your opinion if you asked everyone else, but I loved it. They were something more than dinner; they were comfortable. Boiled eggs are a memory of peace, family, and carefree days as a child to me.</p>

  <p>Boiled eggs always satisfied me as a kid. I can still picture biting down on the mushy white egg, the yellow yolk oozing out and marking my chin. Hearing the bubbles rise as the water boiled thrilled me, sort of like the shot of dopamine running through my system. Waiting for them to cook was even a little thrill unto itself. Eight minutes isn't long, but growing up it seems like an eternity. There was always laughter, chatter, and the smell of breakfast in the kitchen while waiting. It wasn't so much about sitting down to eat as it was about the moment itself and who I was eating with. It was a meal for the whole family. We all gobbled it up, and we all cheered it on, as if a dish so common was worth celebration. Salting a little too liberally—or at least it seemed so—chewing the soft yolk, and watching the steam rise made each time special. And I had it with everything—coffee with a splash of light cream, toast with butter, or even with other eggs.</p>

  <p>Boiled eggs are impossible to get wrong. Christmas specifically brings it to mind each time I enjoy them. The first bite is reminiscent of the holidays, a faraway memory: the smell of pumpkin burning, pies in the oven; the murmurs of laughter and greetings from the living room; the sound of thudding music from the behemoth of a speaker outside. I can hear the fire popping, see the lights blinking too brightly, and smell the hot cocoa wafting through the air. The first sip always burned my tongue, but I never cared. And amidst all that joy and commotion, boiled eggs were present. They weren't the pride of the banquet, but they were there, wrapping everything around their heat. That one nostalgia, which hangs on Christmas morning and nights, is one of the most powerful things I sense from them.</p>

  <p>And then there are the countless permutations boiled eggs produce. Deviled eggs on party platters, egg salad sandwiches, or ramen with a cracked egg on top. Boiled egg ramen in particular is close to my heart. Watching the yolk break into pieces and turn the flavor on its head was magical. It proved that even the most simple food can turn a meal around. Boiled eggs are versatile like that—they always pay off. Even the process of making them is burned in my memory. Place the eggs in the pan, boil for seven to eight minutes, and then remove them gently. I always recommend setting the clock so that there is no anxiety. When the clock finally goes off, you rush and switch off the stove and scoop the eggs out. Of course, you need to let them cool down unless you don't mind scalding your fingers. Peeling them is unwrapping a present, the shell shattering open to expose something smooth and mushy. Press too hard and it breaks open in your hand. Bite too soon and the heat burns, but that's part of the fun. It's sticky, but it's worth it.</p>

  <p>The older I got, the less eggs were a daily part of life, and maybe that's why they mean so much to me now. Nostalgia makes things appear so big when they're small. It teases me even to think about those times, but it's the good hurt—the kind that reminds you where you've been. Boiled eggs remind me happiness doesn't always live in the spectacular. Other times, it is from the everyday things that we take for granted until they are gone. To this day, when I eat one, I am transported back in time. I can hear the voices of my family members speaking, feel the warmth of the kitchen, and taste the happiness of those mornings and holidays. To others, it might just look like a boiled egg. For me, it's memory, tradition, and emotion all together. I joke that it's not a habit but a passion, but maybe it is both. What I'm certain of is that boiled eggs will always be burdened with the weight of childhood.</p>

  <p>Finally, boiled eggs are more than just food to me. They are a means of remembrance. They serve as a reminder that at times peace can come in the smallest, simplest of things. They remind me that moments of family, laughter, and joy can be hidden in something as ordinary as an egg. And to me, it is these small things that truly matter most.</p>
